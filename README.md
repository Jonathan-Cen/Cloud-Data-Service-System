# Cloud Data Service_System

This is part of my Assignment 3 submission to the COMPSCI 345 (Human-Computer Interaction) Course . This assignment aims to develop and evaluate a high-fidelity prototype design as a mockup Web interface, a cloud data service system for university student group work. This assignment allows me to practice high-fidelity design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The design of this prototype aims to support the following users' needs:
- Ecology Need - Need for the ability to store files at a safe location and the ability to access files from anywhere
- Interaction Need - Need for advanced sharing options
- Emotional Need - Need for comfort about the progress being on track
- Emotional Need - Need for comfort about the correct files are shared to the correct recipient(s)
